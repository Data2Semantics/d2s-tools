workflow:
  name: Entropy of sequences
  description: | 
  	This workflow shows a corner case of sweeping over a dynamically
  	generated list of lists. This forces the branches of the sweep to be created
  	during module instantiation.
  	
  modules:
    - module:
        name: sequences
        description: Loads a text file and generates a sample of random n-grams
      
        inputs:
          data: 'alice in wonderland.txt'
          sample size: 6
          sample method: uniform
        
      #output: n-grams - a <list<List<String>> of 6 sampled n-grams
      
  	- module:
  	    name: spread
  	    description: | 
  	      analyzes the spread of the occurrences of the given n-gram 
  	      in the given text 
  	    
  	    inputs:
  	      text file: 'alice in wonderland.txt'
  	      n-gram: sequences.n-gram # List<String>, sweep
  	      
  	    # outputs: spread
  	    
# Edge case: at compile time the workflow parser cannot establish whether the 
# the reference in line 28 represents a single matched type or a sweep. Only 
# at instantiation of the spread module, we can check whether the 
# referenced list is a list of strings (ie, single reference) or a list of lists 
# (sweep).
