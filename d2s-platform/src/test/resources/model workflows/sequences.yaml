  name: Entropy of sequences
  description: | 
  	This workflow shows a corner case of sweeping over a dynamically
  	generated list of lists. This forces the branches of the sweep to be created
  	during module instantiation.
  	
  modules:
    - module:
        name: sequences
        description: Loads a text file and generates a sample of random n-grams
      
      inputs:
        data: 'alice in wonderland.txt'
        sample size: 6
        
      #output: n-grams - a <list<List<String>> of 6 n-grams

  	    name: occurrences
