    - module:

        # Loads a dataset from a file
        
        inputs:
          file: ['data1.csv', 'data2.csv']
        # outputs: data
    
    - module:
        name: experiment
        source: ...
        # Performs an experiment on a dataset, and calculates two performance
        # measures: precision and recall.
        
        inputs:
          data: data.data
        # outputs: precision, recall 
    
    - module:
        name: F score
        # Combines a precision and a recall value into a combined performance
        # measure
        
        inputs:
          precision: experiment.precision
          recall: experiment.recall
          weighting: 0.5
        
        # outputs: f score     
      
# This workflow produces two instances of the F score module. The sweep on line
# 9 causes an execution branch. When the F score module is instantiated it has 
# two inputs from modules with multiple instances. It matches up the inputs 
# belonging to the same branches.
