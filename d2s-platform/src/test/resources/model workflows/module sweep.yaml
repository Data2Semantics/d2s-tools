    This workflow illustrates the possibility of sweeping over a list of modules
    rather than module outputs
    
  modules:
    - module:
        name: data source A
        # outputs: dataset, normalization constant 
        
    - module:
        name: data source B
        # outputs: dataset, normalization constant         

    - module sweep:
        name: dataset
        modules: [data source A, data source B]
        
    - module:
        name: experiment
        # outputs: dataset, normalization constant
        
        inputs: 
          dataset:
            reference: dataset.dataset

          normalization constant: 
            reference: dataset.normalization constant
            
     # If this is implemented, the universe should include which module was
     # chosen for each module sweep which is relevant for the current module
     # being instantiated.
