  description: | 
    This workflow illustrates the possibility of dot products for swept inputs
    in a single module
    
  modules:
    - module:
        name: data source A
        # outputs: dataset, normalization constant 
        
    - module:
        name: data source B
        # outputs: dataset, normalization constant         

    - module:
        name: experiment
        # outputs: dataset, normalization constant
        
        inputs: 
          dataset:
            - reference: A.dataset
            - reference: B.dataset
          normalization constant: 
            - reference: A.normalization constant
            - reference: B.normalization constant
            
        couple: [dataset, normalization constant] # This is where the magic happens
        
        # Couple contains one or more lists with two or more of the inputs if 
        # this module each. Coupled inputs should have multi-inputs of the same 
        # length (to be checked during parsing if possible).
