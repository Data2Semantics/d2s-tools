workflow:
  name: cross entropy
  description: | 
    This workflow shows a situation where we want a cartesian cross product on 
    inputs from thesame branch.
  
  modules:
    - module:
        name: random text 
        # uses a grammar to generate human-looking text
        
        inputs:
          language: [english, german, italian]  
        
        #outputs: text
        
    - module:
        name: cross entropy
        # calculates the cross entropy between two texts
        
        inputs:
          first text: 
            reference: random text.text
            sweep instances: yes
          second text: 
            reference: random text.text
        
        # outputs cross entropy
        
# In default mode, the cross entropy module only runs three times, for the 
# inputs (english, english), (german, german) and (italian, italian).  

# However, when we set the sweep instances flag, we force the workflow to sweep 
# over all instances of the module and create new branches for each. For the 
# inputs without this flag, the inputs of upstream instances are still grouped 
# by existing branch. 

# If we were to set both inputs to sweep instances, we would get 27 instances 
# for the cross entropy module. Both would ignore the current branch and create
# their own branches.
