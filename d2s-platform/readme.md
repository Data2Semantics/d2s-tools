#Overview

DuckTape is a platform to string together experiments from existing code base. It is designed for any of the following situations:

*   You have a simple piece of code that you want to try out with different inputs (a parameter sweep)
*  You have several interconnected pieces of code that you wanted to use in a reproducible experiment.
*  You have an experimental workflow with different pieces of code in different programming languages (* main support currently on Java domain*)
*  You have a piece of code that tests the limits of your computer. You'd like to do a parameter sweep on a cluster, without rewriting everything (under development)
