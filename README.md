Some tools for dealing with RDF data in a Machine Learning/Complexity context

## Running graph kernel experiments

1. Download  d2s-tools source code
2. Download the datasets, available at http://data.semanticweb.org/dumps/, and by request to g.k.d.devries@uva.nl
3. The three experiment files are in d2s-tools/src/main/java/org/data2semantics/tools/, change the path in the code of the three experiments (...Experiment.java) to the location of the data files.
4. Compile and run.
5. Make sure the virtual machine has several gigabytes of heap space.
