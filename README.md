=========

Some tools for dealing with RDF data in a Machine Learning/Complexity context

## Running graph kernel experiments

1. Download the d2s-tools and kernelexperiments source code, both are maven projects, note that the kernelexperiments depends on d2s-tools
2. The datasets are in the datasets folder of the d2s-tools project
3. The four experiment files are in kernelexperiments/src/main/java/org/data2semantics/exp/, change the path in the code of the four experiments (...Experiment.java) to the location of the data files.
4. Compile and run.
5. Make sure the virtual machine has several gigabytes of heap space.
